AIM: IMPLEMENTATION OF MODEL BASED CLUSTERING To write the implementation of clustering techniques using model based clustering. PROCEDURE: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. In model-based clustering, the data are viewed as coming from a distribution that is mixture of two ore more clusters. It finds best fit of models to data and estimates the number of clusters. Install the mclust package as follow: install.packages(“mclust”). Model-based clustering results can be drawn using the base function plot.Mclust() . fviz_mclust() uses a principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionnality of the data. PROGRAM: install.packages("factoextra") install.packages("cluster") install.packages("magrittr") library("cluster") library("factoextra") library("magrittr") library("mclust") data("diabetes") head(diabetes, 3) library(factoextra) # BIC values used for choosing the number of clusters fviz_mclust(mc, "BIC", palette="jco")


# Classification: plot showing the clustering fviz_mclust(mc, "classification", geom="point", pointsize=1.5, palette="jco") # Classification uncertainty fviz_mclust(mc, "uncertainty", palette="jco")

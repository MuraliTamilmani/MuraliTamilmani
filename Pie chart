AIM: DATA VISUALIZATION USING PIE CHART To visualize data using plotty framework. PROCEDURE: 1. 2. In R thepie chartis numbers as a vector input. created using the pie() function which takes positive The additional parameters are used to control labels, color, title etc. 3. 4. a. b. c. d. e. f. 5. The basic syntax for creating a pie-chart using the R is − i. pie(x, labels, radius, main, col, clockwise) Following is the description of the parameters used − 4.a x is a vector containing the numeric values used in the pie chart. 4.b labels is used to give description to the slices. 4.c radius indicates the radius of the circle of the pie chart.(value between −1 and +1). 4.d main indicates the title of the chart. 4.e col indicates the color palette. 4.f clockwise is a logical value indicating if the slices are drawn clockwise or anti clockwise. We   will  use  parameter main to   add  a  title  to  the  chart   and  another  parameter    is col which will make use of rainbow colour pallet while drawing the chart. The length of the pallet should be same as the number of values we have for the chart. Hence we use length(x).

PROGRAM: # Create data for the graph. x <- c(21, 62, 10, 53) labels<- c("London", "New York", "Singapore", "Mumbai") # Give the chart file a name. png(file = "city_title_colours.jpg") # Plot the chart with title and rainbow color pallet. pie(x, labels, main = "City pie chart", col = rainbow(length(x))) # Save the file. dev.off()
